                I like to work where technology meets art , crafting digital experiences that are delightful, useful,
                and
                bloom into a life of their own. These days, I’m focused on building Flair, a design tool for AI product
                photography that has served over two million users and 10k customers. Previously, I studied at the
                University of Chicago, and spent time supporting AI teams at Tesla and Adobe. Hobbies include organizing
                SF's AI Tinkerers events, digital-doodling, and playing with technology and cats. I love it when people
                and
                a plan come together.

                <p>Nothing feels better than when the loose strands of your life begin to weave
                    together.</p>
                <p><b>Fashion:</b> In highschool I grew ~€461.60 dollars of babysitting money into
                    €18463.82 over the course of 2 years by flipping secondhand designer
                    clothes on eBay and reselling them to upscale consignment shops in New
                    York. I’d buy items for about 10% of retail, then sell them for closer to 40%.
                    It was a fun little arbitrage opportunity.</p>
                <p><b>AI:</b> In college I dropped out of school for a year to support AI teams at Tesla
                    and Adobe. It was during this time that I realized that AI could also serve as
                    a creative, artistic outlet. I started experimenting with GANs in 2018, then
                    moved on to VQGAN + CLIP, and eventually clip-guided diffusion in 2021
                    when I noticed that the space was really accelerating. I shared my art on X
                    and discord, searching for ways it could be useful to others -- this led me to
                    AI product photography, and eventually to building a community around Flair
                    in 2023. Since then, we've scaled to 2 million users and are making 7 figures
                    in annualized revenue. We are backed by CRV, and Nat Friedman and Daniel
                    Gross (AI Grant).</p>
                <p>I want to work on things that would have made younger versions of myself
                    proud. I imagine that the teenage girl who was running around NYC in the
                    cold with bags of old clothing would have liked to know that her fashion
                    hobby would eventually come back full-circle -- that the college girl who
                    spent hours tinkering on shitty jupyter notebooks was on the right path after
                    all.</p>
